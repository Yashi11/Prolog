*Data Objects in Prolog*


Data Objects
    1.Simple Objects
        a.Constants
            i) atoms  ii)numbers
        b.Variables
    2.Structures

-> Examples
atoms: tom,pat,x100,x_45
numbers: 100,1234,200.54
Variables: X,Y,Z,Xval,_X
Structures: day(9,jun,2017),point(10,25)

-> Atoms

Atoms can be constructed in three ways:-
A. Strings of letters,digits and the underscore character '_', starting with the lower case letter.For example:- azahar,b53,b_90,b_x80,john_samuels etc.
B. strings of special characters. For eg:- <---->,<=====>,::=,..:.
But we need to be careful here as some strings like :- have a predefined special meaning.
B.Strings of characters in single quotes can also be treated as atoms. This is useful when we want an atom starting with capital lettter for example: 'Rubina','John Samuels','Yuang Choi'

->Numbers

In Prolog, Numbers can be either Integers or Real-Numbers.
As, prolog is primarily a language for symbolic,non-numeric computation, we do not have to use real numbers in typical prolog programming.
We may use integers to count the number of items in a list in Prolog programming.

->Variables

Variables are strings of letters,digits and underscore characters.They satrt with the an upper-case letter or an underscore character. For eg:- C,Sum,Student_list,_a50,_15,Studentlist
Anonymous Variables are represented by _.


->Structures

structure data objects are objects that have multiple components.The components themselves can,in turn, be structures.
For example:- date is a structure with 3 components-day,moth,year
Structures can be represented using tree representation and prolog representations.
